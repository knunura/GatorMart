# GatorMart

## General Description
GatorMart is a San Francisco State University (SFSU) team project conducted 100% virtually utilizing tools such as Zoom, Slack, and Trello. The main idea behind this project was to build a working online store (GatorMart) from the ground up thus going through the entire Software Development Cycle. GatorMart functions like well-known services such as OfferUp and Ebay, except it is strictly restricted to SFSU student and staff. The team behind this project are given specific roles to make up the frontend, backend, teamlead, and github lead roles needed for this project. The Milestone directory contains all the key documents that thuroughly detail the Software Development Cycle of GatorMart.

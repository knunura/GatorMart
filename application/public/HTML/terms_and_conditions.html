                practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall
                not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason

            <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
                suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
                limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything
                through the Service.</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
                for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
                damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
                injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service,
                third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any
                provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such
                damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
                consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
                party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
                without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
                behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
                expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
                Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
                non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
                trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
                makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended
                results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
                interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
                can or will be corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
                Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will
                be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or
                content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
                from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or

            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
                But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
                extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>

                laws.</p>

                restricted parties.</p>
            <h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>
            <h3>Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and

                law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <h3>Waiver</h3>
            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
